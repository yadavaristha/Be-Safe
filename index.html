    <h1>Why Vaccination Is Important</h1>
    <p>The routine and essential vaccinations are devised to protect your children and those around them from diseases like pneumonia, tetanus, measles, rubella, polio, whooping cough, meningitis and many serious diseases. These illnesses may come with more risks for your children than Covid-19.</p>

            <h3>Immunization can help save money</h3>
            <p>It not only consumes all financial savings but at times, pushes families towards financial instability. The family member who is assigned the role of taking care of the sick often finds themselves unable to participate in economic activities and contribute to the income of the family. All of this can be avoided by taking the correct vaccine at the right time</p>

        <div class="importance-col">
            <h3>Immunization is important to 
                protect your family and friends</h3>
            <p>Many preventable diseases are also communicable. Sometimes the person who gets infected survives but someone they know with compromised immunity might succumb.

The coronavirus [SARS‑CoV‑2] is a recent example of one such disease. It is important to get yourself and your child vaccinated against such diseases if you are living with older or sick family members. Immunization not only saves your life but also the lives of people around you.

It is rather a civic duty to ensure complete immunization of yourself and your family. </p>

            <h3>Various types of disabilities in children
                can be avoided by timely immunization and intervention</h3>
            <p>All across the world, disability right movements are picking up and garnering support and forging new ways towards a more accessible, inclusive and sustainable world.

While all these are extremely positive steps, one must not forget to acknowledge the benefits of childhood immunization against disability. The most obvious example remains polio which has been managed by most countries through the oral dose.

Another example is measles which can become a prime cause of blindness, deafness and some forms of mental disability among surviving children. </p>
